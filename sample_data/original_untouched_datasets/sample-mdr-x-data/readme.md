# Data analysis 
In this directory we have stored some sample data that was collected, at the moment, manually. 

# Data preparation
Assuming the code can access the original data, each path is split by `_`, `-`, `.`, `/`.
The idea is to find a suitable way for the users, to annotate the data in a stress-less way.  

# Legend: 
 - sample_data_complete.txt: text file containing one line for each path 
 - sample_data.{1-4}.txt: sample data divided by root directories   


# Some thoughs
 1. we need to find a way to reduce the amount of annotation to the minimal number of line 
 2. we could remove threat the files separately and keep the longest paths
 3. the pattern matching for files and directory could be stored, and annotated separately
